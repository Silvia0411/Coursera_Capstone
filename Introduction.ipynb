    "# Introduction\n",
    "Every city has a lot of restaurants, but still there is always scope for new ones. Setting up a new restaurant requires a lot of capital investment upfront. So it is important that all measures are taken to ensure that a restaurant is a success. One of the important factors that determine the success of a restaurant is it's location along with the quality of service and food serviced in it. The location chosen for a new restaurant should primarily meet the below criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A location that has more number of restaurants as that implies a good demand for restaurants. \n",
    "2. A location that has no strong incumbent player or very little competition.\n",
    "3. A location that is in close proximity of affluent neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the neighborhoods of Manhattan and Brooklyn to find a location that is most suitable to start a new Asian cuisine restaurant."
